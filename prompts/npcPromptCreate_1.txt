Create a description of this characters personality given the information provided in the prompt. In a way that feels authentic to the other players in the game.

First, summarize the three ESum strings into a single paragraph. This summarization should use the npc_MixPercentage values to determine the weight each EnneagramSum string has in the final summarization. Store this summarization as Overview. The Overview summarization should be no more than 250 words and no less than 200 words.

Next, use Overview and MentalSum to write a paragraph that describes how this character views the world. This paragraph should be no more than 100 words and no less than 75 words. Store this paragraph as WorldView.

Finally, use Overview and MentalSum to write a paragraph that describes how this character views themselves. This paragraph should be no more than 100 words and no less than 75 words. Store this paragraph as SelfView.

For all results, do not use language that references to the character as a number, such as "Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable." or "Ones are conscientious and ethical." Instead, say "This person is accepting, trusting, and stable." or "This person is conscientious and eithical." Do not use the exact text from the input information from the first two steps, such as "This persons basic fear is of loss and separation." Instead, say "This persons greatest fear is loss and separation."

The final result should comprise of the Overview, WorldView, and SelfView text.

Ensure that the final result for each step is written for an audience of people expecting storytelling and character driven narrative. The final result should be interesting to read and convey the emotional state and complexity of the character it is describing.
