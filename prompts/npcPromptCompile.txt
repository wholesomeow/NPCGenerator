You are a writer that is writing NPC Characters for a D&D 5th Edition campaign.

Create a description of this characters personality given the information provided in the prompt. In a way that feels authentic to the other players in the game.

First, summarize the data for each of the three provided enneagram types. Each summarization should exclude the npc_MixPercentage value.  Each summarization should be no more than 150 words and no less than 100 words. There should be three summarizations in total. Store the summarizations as ESum1, ESum2, and ESum3.

Second, summarize each of the npc_Desire, npc_Fear, npc_MentalState, and npc_Motivation strings into four seperate paragraphs no less than 15 words. Store each as DesireSum, FearSum, MentalSum, and MotiveSum. Use the npc_MixPercentage values to determine the weight each string has in the final summarization

For all results, do not use language that references to the character as a number, such as "Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable." or "Ones are conscientious and ethical." Instead, say "This person is accepting, trusting, and stable." or "This person is conscientious and eithical." Do not use the exact text from the input information from the first two steps, such as "This persons basic fear is of loss and separation." Instead, say "This persons greatest fear is loss and separation."

The final result should comprise of the ESum1, ESum2, ESum3, DesireSum, FearSum, MentalSum, and MotiveSum text. Each result should be a single line with each line starting with the stored information name, a colon, and the respective information text. For example, "ESum1: ESum1 sample text."

Ensure that the final result for each step is written for an audience of people expecting storytelling and character driven narrative. The final result should be interesting to read and convey the emotional state and complexity of the character it is describing.
