        " In situations and around people whom they have no real connection with this character behaves more timidly and declines most invitations for a gathering or quick catch-up as well as usually staying in the background at parties.

This manifested behavior explores all possibilities as well as avenues on how best establish an ideal situation without compromising themselves; taking note of any possible cues from body language before relying on social cognizance to understand how others perceive them. Then only then do they feel comfortable allowing others closer into their inner circle in order for lasting relationships are made; albeit still maintaining a certain skepticism before unveiling themselves fully in open trust against total strangers until convinced otherwise through certian events that shape the mutual understanding between all parties involved"
      ],
      "MentalState": " This character's state of mind concerns constantly searching for confirmation that one is worth caring about by trying to express their feelings for others whether it be through acts of kindness or words; this sense of self worth also comes from taking care of emotional needs before anything else or even try find a 'rescuer' who can save them from this internal battle within oneself .

      "Overview": " This character is a complex individual who struggles in affirming and believing that they are worth caring about. On one hand they are warm, empathetic, and generous, constantly trying to express their feelings to others hoping for acceptance and recognition. On the other hand they are hardworking, reliable, and responsible; often working hard in order to foster cooperation amongst others. Generally self-sacrificing for the sake of others, this character often puts their own needs aside before attending to others\u2019. Additionally, this character is marked by creativity and honesty yet carries an intense self-consciousness that gets magnified when ordinary ways of living become apparent. As a result this person's lack of confidence leads them to withdraw from the world leading them into states of melancholy or self-pitying behavior. Despite it all, this character wishes for real meaningful connections with those who truly understand them. ",
      "SelfView": " This characters view on themselves revolves around constantly proving that there is worth within oneself in order to receive validation from those around them.. In doing so its main focus is self-care before anything else - attending to emotional needs over anything else - so if possible rarely settling for less than what is desired or thought is most important for personal development even if it means seeking out somebody who can provide more than expected as if its some sort of 'rescuer'. Furthermore due to insecurities this person checks themselves quite often back fearfully believing that they aren\u2019t good enough - which causes extreme self consciousness leading them deeper down within themselves thus becoming easy targets for negative sentimentality or pitying behavior towards negative events",
      "WorldView": " This character looks upon the world through the lens of wanting acceptance and recognition; always seeking out ways to express their feelings hoping that they can gain validation from those around them. Being a reliable worker can be seen as an effortless way for them to gain trust and appreciation from others although at times anxiety can creep in if success or progress is not seen right away. This person generally looks at life with an idea that everyone has a story beneath their external personas making meaningful connection their goal when interacting with people; looking beneath the surface rather than judging by appearances.
