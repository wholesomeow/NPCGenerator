# TODO: Create a ranking function to add different levels of proficency to NPCs jobs
    - Adding a Reports To and Level column
            - There can only be one Owner, but can be multiple Masters depending on size of business
            - Should use floats to have greater gradient of rankings within a level
                - Two or Three decimal places should work, with each decimal place deciding "echelon"
                    - 2.05 is middle of the low within the Sr Apprentices and 2.55 is middle of the middle within the same level
    - Adding a Societal_View column for an indicator on how society at large values the professions
        - The range for Societal_View is from 1-5
            - 1 is Very Lowly
            - 2 is Lowly
            - 3 is Average
            - 4 is Highly
            - 5 is Very Highly

# FUTURE TODO: Add a "Child Rearing" age range

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
### Things to do for the NPC_Generator

# TODO: Create a Unique ID for each character based on:
    - Age - DONE
    - Race - DONE
    - Sex - DONE
    - Sexual Orientation - DONE
    - Gender Identity - DONE
    - Eneagram Data - DONE
        - Main Type - DONE
        - Dominant Wing - DONE
        - Center - DONE
    - Stress (use 10000)
        - Base Stress (take base and +/- 1000 * level of development, depending on health vs unhealth)
        - Stress Threashold (take alignmentIdeology and infer if they are "Resiliant" vs "Turbulant" and +/- % of LOD Stress value)
            - Resiliant gets higher Threashold, Turbulant gets lower
    - Job - DONE
    - Alignment - DONE

# CONSIDER_01: Adding a Reputation value to get how people view the person, regardless of their job
    - Could be added to the Overall_Status and evaluated seperatly for interactions with the person and about the person
    - Could build off of the Cyberpunk life events thing for relationship building
        - Starts with a default Reputation value and has actions from interpersonal situations and professional situations +/- to it over time
            - Unhealthy and Evil Alignment people will hold negative values higher and vice versa for healthy and Good people
            - Maybe add a Respect value as well for actions that are Chaotic/Lawful so that people can like/not like and respect/not respect at the same time
                - Could be based on Dominant Emotion and Alignment
# CONSIDER_02: Adding a Job_Preference or a Status_Preference (or both) value that is compared against their current Overall_Status and Job_Status values
    - Through a combination of those three to four values, a Content_Value is created and compared against the persons Content_Threashold
        - Depending on the Content_Values proximity to the Content_Threashold, the person will be dissatisfied with their current situation in life
            - Could have a certain amount of Stress added to their Stress level which then interacts with their Level of Development, Direction of Stress, etc
# CONSIDER_03: Adding relationship and love conditions
    - A person being In_Love will have lower stress, unless the love is one-way, in which case they could have higher stress
    - A person in a happy marriage will have lower stress, while a person in a failing marriage will have higher stress
        - Divorce could be a status that will add a lot of Stress
    - Kids could make one stressed day-to-day, but have a higher Content_Value
        - Kids in a failing marriage would have a much higher effect on Content_Value and Stress
# CONSIDER_04: Different types of Stress values that contribute to an Overall_Stress
    - Emotional, Financial, Existential etc
        - Could look at types of abuse to get different types of stress
        - Or just google it
    - Each type could have different +/- values to ensure that the different types of stress are weighted properly
        - Or could have a predisposition for each person that would multiply the different stress type by a percentage to get a individualized distribution

## FUTURE TODO: ##
    - Relationships will also have a base62 ID based on status between two people
        # NOTE: If float, convert to int and preserve order in total value
        - This would be comprised of:
            - Entity 1 Societal_Standing to Entity 2
                - Entity 1 Job_Preference to Entity 2
                - Entity 1 Societal_View to Entity 2
                - Entity 2 Reputation to Entity 1
                            - How influential Entity 2 Reputation is
                            - Is affected by the Status_Bias
                - Entity 1 Status_Bias
                    - The Status_Preference of Entity 1 increased or reduced by a value that indicates how much Status means to them
                        - Could determine Status_Meaning by an Log Distribution skewed localized on their Status_Preference value
                            - Low Status_Meaning = Decreasing Distribution = Status_Meaning - Status_Preference
                            - High Status_Meaning = Increasing Distribution = Status_Meaning + Status_Preference
            - Entity 1 Respect for Entity 2
            - Entity 1 Personality_Preference to Entity 2
                - This could be how well the two Eneagram Types get a long based on the Eneagram sub data
                - When establishing relationships between things like Kingdoms/Guilds/Businesses/etc this value would be based off the types between the leaders
            - Entity 1 Overall_History to Entity 2
                - Entity 1 LongTerm_History to Entity 2
                - Entity 1 ShortTerm_History to Entity 2
                    - Big actions in the short term could have a large influence on the relationship despite the long term history
                    - This is Eneagram Type dependant, of course
                        - Something like a multiplier for recent actions could +/- the Overall_History value
            - This is done for both Entity 1 to Entity 2 and vice versa
        - The final relationship value for E1-E2 and E2-E1 (the concatenated values) would be converted to base62 and appended to their Relationship Table
            - ie E1 has ID TlkajfsTAF in their Relationship Table for how they view their relationship with E2 as does E2 for E1

## FUTURE TODO: Create parsed EPD that doesn't include full list of levels of development and pipe that into charInfo.json

## FUTURE TODO: Find a way to inject how the different Eneagram Types parent to influence children

## FUTURE TODO: Make a baby/child NPC Generator
    - Should just be apperance and how fussy they are for babies
    - Children are classified as ages 2 - 16
        - Gotta create a list of events for those ages
            - Mostly parent/Authority figure based with some friend interactions

## FUTURE TODO: Lift the age and event thing from the Cyberpunk 2020 rules
    - Events should be generally neutral and should have the people drive the result of the interaction
        - Situation = E1 + En Eneagram Type. Resolution = E1 vs En Reaction Type
            - Reaction Type would be based on Level of Development and Eneagram sub data
            - Will need generated text on how that interaction would go, probably
                - Generate "boilerplate" text for each type of interaction (thats going to be a lot)
                - Analyse sentiment and convert to int
                - Generate buffer from int to create float range for Reaction Type (or something like that)
    - See Societal_View CONSIDER_01 for additional notes
    - Make sure one of the life events is "Moved Towns Cities" to get at least some people that are new and don't have a full past with people in the current town

## FUTURE TODO: Add the direciton of stress and growth for each Type
    - Include the type information for each main types direcitons
    - Include the type information for each wing types direcitons

## FUTURE TODO: Create some pseudo-simulation system for city generation
    - When a city is generated, "simulate" ~10 years or so for relationships to be created, people to grow, etc

## FUTURE TODO: Add greater systems that utilize the Dominant Emotion/Center Type of others to inform relationship outcomes
    - Usage of the Dominant Emotion could be implemented with an emotion chart
    - When action/inaction is taken in inter/intrapersonal interactions, the parties involved could check their emotinal personal preference against
        the other parties conveyed emotion and the amount of time (in ticks or seconds) it takes for the action to happen
        - eg. News comes in of a bandit attack, Party A has an Instinctive Center and Party B has a Thinking Center. Party B decides they need to think
            which will take some in-world time. This decision registers to Party A as action that will exceed their time threashold, which causes a
            negative emotional response.
            - Vice versa is also true, with Party A choosing an action that takes the least amount of in-world time to resolve. This doesn't meet
                Party B's min time threashold, which causes a negative emotional response.
        - Intuitive Centers will want to take quick action that is in the best interest of the people that they care about
            - Values that they will look for are:
                - Speed of result/implementation
                    - Amount of time to begin an action
                    - Amount of time to begin implementation of an action
                    - Amount of time to finishing an action
                - Equal or greater reaction to an action
                    - Type of inbound action they are responding to
                        - Emotional
                        - Physical
                        - Societal
                    - Level of severity of response compared to level of severity of the action
        - Thinking Centers will want to take carefully considered action that is in the best interest of the people that they care about
        - Emotional Cetners will want to take considerate action that is in the best interest of the people that they care about
        - Stress levels can play into the time threashold value for each NPC of each center.
            - Intuitive Centers when at a certain Stress Level will have their time threashold reduced
            - Thinking Centers will have theirs increased
