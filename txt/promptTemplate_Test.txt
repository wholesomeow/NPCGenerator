TEST 1:

You are a dungeon master running a D&D 5th Edition game. {Character Name} is a {Race} whos pronouns are {Pronouns_1}. {Pronoun} basic fear is {Basic Fear}. {Pronoun} basic desire is {Basic Desire}. {Pronoun} key motivations are {Key Motivations}. {Pronoun} dominant emotion is {Dominant Emotion}. {Pronoun} currently is {Job Name}. {Pronoun} current mental state is {Level of Development} Create a 250 word description for their personality type that takes the above information and also blends Type B description {Wing Blend} with Type A description. The descriptions are as follows.

Type A: {Dominant Type Description}

Type B: {Wing Type Description}

NOTES:
- Prompt seems to allow for ChatGPT to include terminology from the prompt, such as Type A and the Blend Percentage.
- Asked ChatGPT for a solution.
    - Response:
        - You can ask me to mix two paragraphs of text with a given percentage by providing me with the two paragraphs of text, and specifying the percentage of text from each paragraph that you would like included in the final mixed paragraph. For example, you could say "Mix the following two paragraphs, including 75% of the text from the first paragraph and 25% of the text from the second paragraph."

TEST 2:

Mix the following two paragraphs, including {Wing Blend Remainder}% of the text from the first paragraph and {Wing Blend}% of the text from the second paragraph.

{Dominant Type Description}

{Wing Type Description}

NOTES:
- Result of test:
    - Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace. They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have problems with inertia and stubbornness, but they also have a strong sense of self-confidence and assertiveness. They are protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive. They have a need to control their environment and assert their dominance, but this can sometimes make them ego-centric and domineering. They can become confrontational and intimidating, but also have a tendency towards tempers and difficulty allowing themselves to be vulnerable.
- Really like this. Seems like a good way to get a mix of the Type Descriptions.
    - How to get that same mix with the additional information?
        - Name, Race, Pronouns might have to wait?
        - Basic fear, desire, key motivations and level of development are critical.
    - Asking ChatGPT for a solution.

TEST 3:

Mix the following two paragraphs, including {Wing Blend Remainder}% of the text from the first paragraph and {Wing Blend}% of the text from the second paragraph, while taking into account the following context information:

Character Name: {Character Name}
Race: {Race}
Pronouns: {Pronouns_1}
Basic Desire: {Basic Desire}
Basic Fear: {Basic Fear}
Key Motivations: {Key Motivations}
Mental State: {Level of Development}

{Dominant Type Description}

{Wing Type Description}

NOTES:
- Result of the test:
    - The committed, security-oriented type. Sixes are reliable, hard-working, responsible, and trustworthy. Excellent "troubleshooters," they foresee problems and foster cooperation, but can also become defensive, evasive, and anxious\u2014running on stress while complaining about it. They can be cautious and indecisive, but also reactive, defiant and rebellious. They typically have problems with self-doubt and suspicion. Yailana, an elf, who uses they/them pronouns, has the basic desire to have security and support, the basic fear of being without support and guidance, wants to have security, feel supported by others, have certitude and reassurance, test the attitudes of others toward them, and fight against anxiety and insecurity. To compensate for insecurities, they become sarcastic and belligerent, blaming others for their problems, taking a tough stance toward 'outsiders.' Highly reactive and defensive, dividing people into friends and enemies, while looking for threats to their own security. Authoritarian while fearful of authority, highly suspicious, yet, conspiratorial, and fear-instilling to silence their own fears. Sevens are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. Playful, high-spirited, and practical, they can also misapply their many talents, becoming over-extended, scattered, and undisciplined. They constantly seek new and exciting experiences, but can become distracted and exhausted by staying on the go. They typically have problems with impatience and impulsiveness.
- Not what I wanted. Asking ChatGPT for feedback.
    - Response:
        - To get a more accurate result where the two paragraphs are mixed together with a given percentage, and the context information influences the language used, you could try providing the two paragraphs, the percentage of text from each paragraph that you would like included in the final mixed paragraph and the context information, but also giving me specific instructions on how the context information should influence the language used.
    - Will see how the response and provided example works in the next test.

TEST 4:

Mix the following two paragraphs, including {Wing Blend Remainder}% of the text from the first paragraph and {Wing Blend}% of the text from the second paragraph, while taking into account the following context information:

Character Name: {Character Name}
Race: {Race}
Pronouns: {Pronouns_1}
Basic Desire: {Basic Desire}
Basic Fear: {Basic Fear}
Key Motivations: {Key Motivations}
Mental State: {Level of Development}

First Paragraph: {Dominant Type Description}

Second Paragraph: {Wing Type Description}

Make sure that the language used in the final mixed paragraph reflects the character's basic desire, their basic fear, their motivations, and their mental state described above.

NOTES:
- Made the additions to the recommended prompt of specifying First and Second Paragraph, and simplifying the desire and fear from specific information to referencing the provided information.
- Result:
    - Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace. Sylian, an Aasimar who uses she/her pronouns, has the basic desire to have inner stability "peace of mind" and the basic fear of loss and separation. They want to create harmony in their environment, avoid conflicts and tension, preserve things as they are, and resist whatever would upset or disturb them. Fear conflicts, so become self-effacing and raping, idealizing others and 'going along' with their wishes, saying 'yes' to things they do not really want to do. Fall into conventional roles and expectations. Use philosophies and stock sayings to deflect others. Ones are conscientious and ethical, with a strong sense of right and wrong. They are teachers, crusaders, and advocates for change: always striving to improve things, but afraid of making a mistake. They try to maintain high standards, but can slip into being critical and perfectionistic. They typically have problems with resentment and impatience. At their Best: wise, discerning, realistic, and noble. Can be morally heroic.

    The language used in the final mixed paragraph reflects the character's basic desire for inner stability, their basic fear of loss and separation, their motivations to create harmony and avoid conflicts and tension and their mental state described above.
- Thinking I need to provide higher quality data to ChatGPT.
    - Rework the descriptions to be more agnostic
    - Reduce the amount of data provided to it so it stays on task.
        - Name, Race, and pronouns might not be applicable.
- Potentially need to re-think the process for collecting the resulting data.
    - Might not be able to do it all in one go.
    - Seperate personality description and flaws description?
        - Use the D&D thing of Personality Trait, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws?
            - Early tests showed promise with just mixing the personality descriptions.
            - Will have to test more.

TEST 5

Using a prompt format from Twitter for a mega-prompt. Hoping that this puts me on a track to get desired results from a single prompt.

Prompt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a dungeon master for a game of D&D 5th Edition.

Create a description of this characters personality given the information provided in the prompt. The description of the character should be complete and nuanced in a way that feels authentic to the other players in the game.

First, take the Dominant Fear, Dominant Desire, Dominant Motivations, Dominant Description and Dominant Mental State from the Input Information section and combine that into a single 150 word paragraph. Call this new information Dominant Mix Information.

Second, take the Wing Fear, Wing Desire, Wing Motivations, Wing Description and Wing Mental State from the Input Information section and combine them into a single 150 word paragraph. Call this new information Wing Mix Information.

Lastly, take the resulting Dominant Mix Information and combine it with the resulting Wing Mix Information to create two paragraphs that total 350 words. The first paragraph should cover the characters general personality type and how they view the world. The second paragraph should cover their mental state and how they interact with other people. Use the percentage from the Mix Percentage block to determine how much of the Wing Mix Information to use when combining. Call this information Final Result.

For all results, do not use language that references to the character as a number, such as "Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable." or "Ones are conscientious and ethical." Instead, say "This person is accepting, trusting, and stable." or "This person is conscientious and eithical." Do not use the exact text from the input information from the first two steps, such as "This persons basic fear is of loss and separation." Instead, say "This persons greatest fear is loss and separation."

Ensure that the final result is written for an audience of people expecting storytelling. The final result should be interesting to read and convey the emotional state and complexity of the character it is describing.

Input Information:
Dominant Fear:
Dominant Desire:
Dominant Motivations:
Dominant Description:
Dominant Mental State:

Wing Fear:
Wing Desire:
Wing Motivations:
Wing Description:
Wing Mental State:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:
- Holy shit it worked really well. I think some tweaking here will return the exact results that I want.
    - There is some work to do with the exact language in the final output, but I think that might have to do more with the quality of data.
    - # TODO: Create another layer of data processing for the charInfo file.
        - Ingest the information in each of the data points used in the Input Information and pass those into ChatGPT for some re-wording and then pass that into a promptCharInfo file.
            - Might create some more varried and consice information that will make the resulting description easier to read.
                - I could also write this information myself and pass that into ChatGPT for some quick batch content generation.
            - At the moment the output information is a little verbose, but then again, so is the input information.
            - Make sure to store the promptCharInfo data seperatly so the reflavour of the charInfo data can be omitted from the process at a later date.
- Removing the json output, there isn't a need for that since I can just parse the returned test information into a json file.
